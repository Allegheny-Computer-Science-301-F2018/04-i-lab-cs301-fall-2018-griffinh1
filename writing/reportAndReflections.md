Question 10.
After the talk with Dr. Beckey Dawson  and Dr. Amelia Finaret one thing that really resonated with me was what they were doing in their work. Often when you think of computer science you do not think about how useful the stuff that we do is because most of the time we are just taking data that has no meaning to us and trying to find trends or solutions to figurative problems. After hear both of them in not exactly computer science fields but working with data just as we do, policy making and hearing them talk about how they are use data from doctors offices close to here finding real trends and issues. It was awesome to here that what we are doing can really make a difference in this world and people who work with data are very needed. That has always been one thing that I found so awesome about computer science is that yes we may become a computer scientist but you can work in almost any field whether that be global heath, economics, psychology, biology, and so many more.
