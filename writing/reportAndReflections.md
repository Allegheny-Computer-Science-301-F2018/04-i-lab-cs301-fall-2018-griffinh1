Question 7.
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5436a1.htm
This report I found has the "Direct and Indirect Effects of Routine Vaccination of Children with 7-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine on Incidence of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease --- United States, 1998--2003" This report is great because it is from the CDC which is a government website that I believe is rather credible. The data that is used though is not as long of a period of time as the other source of data we were previously using. It as the full report, all of the references, who the report was by, editorial notesalong with figures and data sets at the end. If you were looking for other diseases and how they are directly and indirectly effected by routine vaccinations I feel this would be a great source for data.


Question 8.
Q:What is the damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article which states (incorrectly) that autism is a result of vaccines?

A:The damage is that with this article released many parents will take it as the truth and not get their kids vaccinated and it will increase the virus rate because more children will be prone to getting it because they will not have been vaccinated.

Q:What should the role of academic research groups and organizations be to ensure that published information is absolutely correct (i.e., has been properly analyzed) before public exposure?

A:The academic researchers should have to go though thorough examinations of all of the information before it it published to ensure that the information is credible and correct. We do not need anymore incorrect information to be released to the public.

Q:The researcher retracted his paper, which means that he no longer supports its content. Is retracting a paper enough to fix the damage to public medicine? How could the damage be fixed if this you do not think that this is enough?

A:No I do not believe retracting a paper is enough. I believe the man went to jail and I think that is also something that should happen. He put many children's lives at risk. People doing research should not only be looking for correctness they need to look at the ethics of their studies as well.

This is the data that I found on the World Health Organization on "Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) Immunization coverage estimates by country" This data shows how much the immunization covers for DTP3. It is a key measure of immunization system performance. Telling us the data on how well the immunization works.

Question 10.
After the talk with Dr. Beckey Dawson  and Dr. Amelia Finaret one thing that really resonated with me was what they were doing in their work. Often when you think of computer science you do not think about how useful the stuff that we do is because most of the time we are just taking data that has no meaning to us and trying to find trends or solutions to figurative problems. After hear both of them in not exactly computer science fields but working with data just as we do, policy making and hearing them talk about how they are use data from doctors offices close to here finding real trends and issues. It was awesome to here that what we are doing can really make a difference in this world and people who work with data are very needed. That has always been one thing that I found so awesome about computer science is that yes we may become a computer scientist but you can work in almost any field whether that be global heath, economics, psychology, biology, and so many more.
